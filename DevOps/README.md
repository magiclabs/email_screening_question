# Overview
Usually it's more comfortable to use Terraform modules than just "long" manifests. This repo contains `state-metrics` K8s service namespace and deployment manifest.

## Requirements
* Local K8s cluster >= v1.24

# Task
* Install `state-metrics` with given terraform manifests (you may need to update `config_path` in the `_provider.tf` file)
  ```
  terraform init
  terraform apply
  ```
* Modify code to make `state-metrics` to be presented as module.
* Migrate currently deployed service from "plain manifest" to terraform module.
  * No pod should be recreated during the migration
  * Module should have some input variables to customize created resources
* Provide module and all related migration commands in the solution

## How to check
In order to check if `state-metrics` is working just follow these steps:

1. Get `state-metrics` pod ip with
  ```sh
  kubectl get pods -o wide --all-namespaces | grep state
  ```
2. Run some container with `curl` installed inside K8s with shell. For example:
  ```sh
  kubectl run some-cli --rm -i -t   --image curlimages/curl  --overrides='{"kind":"Pod", "apiVersion":"v1", "spec": {"hostNetwork": true}}'   -- sh
  ```
3. Run
  ```sh
  curl ${STATE_METRICS_POD_IP}:18081/metrics
  ```

# Evaluation Criteria
We will be evaluating your submission based on the following criteria, in no particular order:
* Readability: Consistent styling, properly named functions, and variables.
* Correctness: In other words, the end product should be something that you wouldn't hesitate to hit shippit on and productionize!
